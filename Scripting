Just like LoadRunner, OATS replace users on internet browsers with its agent which run scripts.
Scripts can be created automatically by using a proxy program to capture what goes through the wire when the real app is run.

Unlike LoadRunner, OATS uses the same scripting technology for both functional and performance testing.

CAUTION: OATS is usually behind in support of browser levels.
This means that specific older versions of browsers need to be installed,
with automatic updates turned OFF.

	* OpenScript WebDOM Extension

Support by OATS 12.1 for Internet Explorer 9 with add-on:

XPath is used by scripts to identify UI elements.

For maintainability, code from Master scripts are separated into Child script assets called by the master.
