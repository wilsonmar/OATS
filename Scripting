Just like LoadRunner, OATS replace users on internet browsers with its agent which run scripts.
Scripts can be created automatically by using a proxy program to capture what goes through the wire when the real app is run.

Unlike LoadRunner, OATS uses the same scripting technology for both functional and performance testing.

CAUTION: OATS is usually behind in support of browser levels.
This means that specific older versions of browsers need to be installed,
with automatic updates turned OFF.

Support by OATS 12.1 for Firefox 6 with:

	* OpenScript WebDOM Extension

Support by OATS 12.1 for Internet Explorer 9 with add-on:

	* OpenScript Tool Bar (under IE Alt+View menu Toolbars)
	* OpenScript BHO
 
XPath is used by scripts to identify UI elements.

For maintainability, code from Master scripts are separated into Child script assets called by the master.

## Script event structure

The Java Code view has the following standard procedures:

* initialize()  - corresponds to the Initialize node of the Tree View and executes
any custom code added once at the beginning of script playback.

* run()  - corresponds to the Run node of the Tree View and executes recorded and
custom code one or more times during script playback depending upon databanks
or other custom programming.

* finish()  - corresponds to the Finish node of the Tree View and executes any
custom code added once at the end of script playback

Specify how the scenario starts and runs in the Autopilot tab. 
The Autopilot controls the starting and stopping of the
scenario, the rate at which new virtual users are started, and shows the total number of
virtual users and the number of running virtual users.
You specify the session, start and stop times, and the virtual user rampup
specifications for the Submitted Scenario Profile.

Select the ServerStats configuration to apply to the load test scenario. 
ServerStats configurations define the metrics or metric profiles to
use to monitor server-side application, database, system, and Web server statistics
during a load test scenario.
