OATS (Oracle Application Testing Suite)
enables functional and performance testing of Oracle applications.

Its marketing home page is at
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oem/app-test/etest-101273.html

Versions are aligned with Oracle apps:

	* 12.5.0.1.0 (current)
	* 12.4.0.2.0 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oem/downloads/apptesting-downloads-1983826.html
	* 12.3.0.1.0 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oem/downloads/app-testing-download-2199741.html

Unlike offerings from HP, SOASTA, etc. that can test a wide variety of systems,
OATS is focused on Oracle apps only and uses only Oracle technologies:

	* Oracle XE Database version 11g Release 2
	* WebLogic Server version 10.3.5.0

The experienced labor pool is likely to be smaller and thus more expensive
than with HP or other tools.

The download

is **for Windows and Linux only**.

	* **Oracle OpenScript for Windows** is also called 
		**Oracle Functional Testing** scripts written in Java using Eclipse IDE.
	* **Oracle Test Manager (OTM)** organizes and manages the testing process.
	* **Oracle Load Testing (OLT)** also includes server side monitoring and reporting
	* **Agent**
